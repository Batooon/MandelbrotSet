Hello! This is Mandelbrot Set, or in other words just a fractal. A fractal is such a figure, the smaller parts of which are similar to the figure itself when magnified. Mandelbrot Set is just one of the types of fractals, there are a lot of them and they are all very beautiful. This project was written using the Unity Engine. Unity provides several different types of shaders for various tasks that can be programmed. I created this fractal practicing shader programming. All the code regarding the fractal is in the shader script. This was my first experience with shaders!
